# Feedreader Testing

## Description

This is the last project in Udacity's Front-End nanodegree program. It is a feedreader web application for which we, the students, are supposed to write tests using Jasmine, a unit-testing framework for Javascript. The application was provided to us by Udacity. Our contribution to this project lies in the feedreader.js file.
